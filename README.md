## Nitrogen Extended FABIO

### Aim and Objectives

- The aim of this study is to estimate nitrogen footprint embedded in global food supply chain using EE-MRIO analysis based on a nitrogen extended FABIO model.

- The Objectives are:
1. Construct a nitrogen extended FABIO model at commodity detail
2. Estimate reactive nitrogen emissions embedded in global food supply chain through MRIO analysis 
3. Quantify and assess the impact of production, global food trading and consumption of nitrogen-rich food products on nitrogen pollution 
4. Provide policy implications in integrated nutrient management and nitrogen pollution control

### Method

The study sums up **production NFP** and **consumption NFP** (See N calculator). The production NFP calculation is comprised of 5 parts: collecting detailed data for crop/livestock, calculating nitrogen emissions, converting classifications, integrating the two sets of nitrogen emissions data, and performing an extended IO analysis.
